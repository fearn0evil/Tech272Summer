Azealia Amanda Banks (/əˈziːliə/ ə-ZEE-lee-ə; born May 31, 1991) is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. Raised in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, she began releasing music through Myspace in 2008 before being signed to XL Recordings at age 18. She subsequently signed with Interscope and Polydor Records before separating in 2013. Banks became an independent artist and started her own independent record label, Chaos & Glory Recordings. She later signed to Parlophone and Warner Records before quitting her label in 2023.

Banks's song "212" has been listed as one of the best songs of 2011 and one of the defining songs of the decade by music publications, including Rolling Stone and Billboard. She has since released two mixtapes (Fantasea in 2012 and Slay-Z in 2016), a studio album (Broke with Expensive Taste in 2014), and two extended plays (1991 in 2012 and Icy Colors Change in 2018). In 2017, Banks had her film debut in the musical drama Love Beats Rhymes, portraying the lead character. Banks's works have garnered acclaim from critics, drawing on various sounds including house, rap, pop, electronic music, and avant-garde.

Throughout her career, Banks's social media presence and outspoken views, especially on U.S. politics and race, as well as disputes with other artists,[5] have attracted significant controversy.[6][7] Complex noted in 2014 that "she gets more attention for her public feuds than she does for her music".[6]

Life and career
Early life and career beginnings
Azealia Amanda Banks was born on May 31, 1991, in New York City's Manhattan borough; she was the youngest of three.[8][9] Her single mother raised her and her two siblings in Harlem, after their father died of pancreatic cancer when she was two years old.[10] Following her father's death, Banks says that her mother "became really abusive—physically and verbally. Like she would hit me and my sisters with baseball bats, bang our heads up against walls, and she would always tell me I was ugly. I remember once she threw out all the food in the fridge, just so we wouldn't have anything to eat." Due to escalating violence, Banks moved out of her mother's home at age 14 to live with her older sister.[11]

At a young age, Banks became interested in musical theater, dancing, acting, and singing. At 16, she starred in a production of the comedy-noir musical City of Angels, where she was found by an agent who sent her to auditions for TBS, Nickelodeon, and Law & Order, all without success.[12] At this point Banks decided to end her pursuit of an acting career, citing the stiff competition and overall sense of nonfulfillment.[13] Because of this lack of fulfillment, she began writing rap and R&B songs as a creative outlet. She never finished high school, instead choosing to follow her dream of becoming a recording artist.[8]

Under the moniker Miss Bank$, she released her debut recording, "Gimme a Chance" online on November 9, 2008.[12] The recording was accompanied by the self-produced track "Seventeen", which sampled the Ladytron song of the same name. Banks sent both tracks to American DJ Diplo.[14] Later that year, she signed a development deal with record label XL Recordings and began working with producer Richard Russell in London, leaving the label later that year due to conflicting ideas.[15][16]

Richard [Russell] was cool, but as soon as I didn't want to use his beats, it got real sour. He wound up calling me "amateur" and the XL interns started talking shit about me. It just got real fucking funny. I was like, "I didn't come here for a date. I came here to cut some fucking records." I got turned off on the music industry and disappeared for a bit. I went into a bit of a depression.

—Banks talking of her departure from XL Recordings[16]

After leaving XL Recordings, Banks dropped the 'Miss Bank$' moniker and formally became Azealia Banks, which preceded a move to Montreal. Using YouTube as a portal, she uploaded several demo tracks, including "L8R" and a cover of "Slow Hands" by Interpol. After her Canadian visa expired, Banks returned to New York, where she sold keychains at a Manhattan jazz club and danced at a Queens strip club to make ends meet.[12] "That's when I was really depressed", Banks said. "I don't have a manager, I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have any friends, I don't have any money. Here I am working at the strip club, trying not to say the wrong thing and get into fights with these girls who don't give a shit."[12]

In September 2011, Banks released her debut single, "212", as a free digital download from her website. It was released officially on December 6, 2011, as the lead single from her EP 1991.[17] The track attained moderate European chart success, peaking at No. 14 in the Netherlands, No. 12 in the United Kingdom and No. 7 in Ireland.[18][19][20]

Though unsigned at the time, Banks began working with British producer Paul Epworth on a debut studio album.[21] It was announced in December 2011 that she would feature on "Shady Love", a track on American band Scissor Sisters' fourth studio album, Magic Hour, though the feature was uncredited. An accompanying video was released in January 2012 following its radio premiere from Annie Mac (BBC Radio 1) on January 4,[22] though the single's release was canceled for unconfirmed reasons. Banks released the track "NEEDSUMLUV (SXLND)" online on January 16, 2012, coinciding with what would have been the 33rd birthday of the late singer Aaliyah, who is sampled on the track.[23] A week later saw the emergence of a second track, "Bambi", produced by Paul Epworth and selected as the soundtrack for a Thierry Mugler fashion show in Paris.[24]

In May 2012, Banks announced plans to release a mixtape—originally titled Fantastic—titled Fantasea.[25] Preceding its release the tracks "Jumanji",[26] "Aquababe",[27] and "Nathan" (featuring rapper Styles P) were made available online.[28] Fantasea was released via Banks's Twitter account on July 11,[29] and was succeeded by the unveiling of her online radio project Kunt.FM the following week.[30]

Banks's first EP, 1991, was released in the UK on May 28 and in the US the next day.[31] The 4-track EP, which includes 212, was not eligible for the UK Albums chart, but the title track charted at No. 79 on the UK Singles chart.[32] It also reached No. 133 on the US 200,[33] while reaching No. 17 on the US R&B/Hip-Hop chart,[34] No. 12 on the US Rap chart,[35] and headin' US Heat chart.[36] In 2013, 1991 was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.[37]

Banks was scheduled to release her second single, "Esta Noche", from Fantasea, on September 25, 2012, but it was pulled the day of its release due to sampling disputes between Banks and its producer, Munchi.[38] The next month, it was confirmed that Banks had worked with Lady Gaga on two tracks, "Ratchet" and "Red Flame", on Gaga's third studio album, Artpop (2013), but they did not make the final album cut, and have not been released.[39] Banks also revealed that she collaborated with Kanye West on G.O.O.D. Music's compilation album Cruel Summer but that her contributions did not make the final cut.[39][40] On December 31, 2012, Banks released "BBD", which ultimately appeared on her debut album, Broke with Expensive Taste.

Banks has said she admires American recording artists Beyoncé and Aaliyah, calling the former "the queen of everything. She's the most remarkable performer and musician. And this is just my humble opinion, but I just think she's better than everyone else making music right now."[97] Banks is inspired by, and has drawn directly upon, black gay culture, such as the film Paris Is Burning, in her music.[98]

AllMusic characterizes Banks as "a stylish vocalist who combines hardcore hip-hop, indie pop, and dance music".[99] Meanwhile, The Guardian's John Robinson considered Banks's style "an appealing blend of Missy Elliott and dance-pop".[100] In regards to her musical style, Banks has frequently been noted for the use of profanity in many of her songs, particularly her reclamation of the word "cunt",[101][102][103] examples including her debut single "212", in which she uses the word more than ten times, or other songs such as "Fierce", in which she refers to herself as the "cunt queen".[104][105] Banks attributes this to her upbringing in Harlem, saying, "...I'm from Harlem. I went to art school; I grew up with the cunts. And that term doesn't come from me! People think I invented it, but I didn't. To be cunty is to be feminine and to be, like, aware of yourself. Nobody's fucking with that inner strength and delicateness. The cunts, the gay men, adore that. My friends would say, 'Oh you need to cunt it up! You're being too banjee.' Banjee means unrefined and rough. You need your cunts: they fix your hair for you and do your makeup. They give you confidence and give you life."[97] She is also known for her often fast-paced rapping, or "flow".[103] In a review of Banks's debut EP 1991, Chris Dart of Exclaim! found Banks's rapping speed "remarkable", commenting that she "manages a feat that takes most rappers the better part of a career to master: the perfect marriage of bangin', club-friendly beats and smart, crisply delivered lyrics".[106]

Since writing "212", Banks has adopted an alter ego, "Yung Rapunxel". This alter ego was adapted from Banks calling herself Rapunzel due to a long weave she wore while working at Starbucks as a teenager. Banks discussed this with Rolling Stone saying, "Yung Rapunxel is that girl who pisses people off but doesn't really mean to. She's actually a sweetheart! But people are so taken aback that she's so herself; she's not even trying to be unique or different. She literally just lives in her head; she does what she wants to do. So, the lipstick is here for someone who is happy to be themself."[97]

Personal life
In October 2019, Banks announced that she would perform under the name Azilka (Russian: Азилька) during her tour in post-Soviet countries.[1]

On August 8, 2020, Banks announced that she intended to end her life by euthanasia and document the process on film.[107]

In February 2021, Banks publicly announced her engagement to American artist Ryder Ripps.[108] They made an audio sex tape and sold it using NFT, which was then up for resale for $260 million.[109] In March, Banks announced the end of the relationship.[110]

Health
In July 2016, Banks admitted to lightening her skin due to skin blemishes from her birth control and defended the process of skin bleaching.[111] In December 2016, she revealed that she had had a miscarriage and asked her fans for advice and support.[112]

BuzzFeed News wrote Banks "has been frank about her own mental health issues".[113] In 2020, during a plea deal in Manhattan Court to avoid prison time, she was ordered to seek mental health treatment.[114] The British magazine gal-dem reported that she has bipolar disorder.[115]
